# Python Web Scraper Project

## Project Overview
This Python web scraper is designed to automate the process of extracting information from specified web pages. It's built with Python using libraries such as Requests and BeautifulSoup for fetching and parsing web content.

### Features
- Extracts data from web pages using HTTP requests.
- Parses HTML content to retrieve specific information.
- Can handle pagination and multi-page scraping.
- Saves extracted data in a structured format (CSV, JSON).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can download it from the official Python [website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-web-scraper.git
cd python-web-scraper
```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (Optional, but recommended)**
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. **Install the required packages**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
Modify the scraper settings (if necessary) by editing config.py or the relevant section in main.py.
